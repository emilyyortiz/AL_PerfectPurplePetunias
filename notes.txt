DISCO:
- Because we are working with an ArrayList, we cannot use syntax that is usually used for arrays like a[i] or a.length.
Instead we used syntax specific for ArrayList on the javaapi like get() and size()
- get() works similar to a[i] and size() is similar to a.length
- can set a new ArrayList to an old ArrayList (ie. notsort=sort)

QCC:
- What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy and when should we use them

We don't have to write methods such as set, remove, etc. in the wrapper class because these methods will work the same as in ArrayList.
