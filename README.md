### OrderedArrayList

#### Helper Method: FindIndex

Takes an int and returns which index it should be added into to maintain ascending order.
Will help keep order so that we do not need a complicated "Sort" method (and if we end up needing one, it will be more easily creatable with this helper)

#### Add

Takes an int and edits the superarray to include that int.
A modified add-at-index with its index at the appropriate "FindIndex" of the arg so that it maintains ascending order.

#### Remove

Takes an int index and edits the value of the superarray to remove the value at that index.
Should be a direct replica of Remove from superarray.

#### Get

Takes an int index and returns the value of the superarray at that index.
Should be a direct replica of Get from superarray.

#### IsSorted

Returns whether or not the superarray is sorted.
